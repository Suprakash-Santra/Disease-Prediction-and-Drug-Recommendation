# Disease-Prediction-and-Drug-Recommendation
This project is a Disease Prediction and Drug Recommendation System that uses machine learning and symptom analysis to predict the most likely disease a user may have based on their input symptoms. Once the disease is identified, the system suggests recommended drugs/medications that are commonly used for treatment.

The project aims to assist patients, healthcare professionals, and researchers by providing a quick and intelligent tool for early diagnosis support and treatment guidance.
